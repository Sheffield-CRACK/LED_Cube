# Trackellite
Software for desktop satellite tracking toy. 
Will query for TLE files daily, and produce a grid of how many satellites are where in real time.

Checklist:
- [DONE] [SLOW, DONT USE] Query N2YO for satellites
- [DONE] Compute my own satellite locations
- Figure out how to plug the grid into LED matrix
  - LED matrix, c.f. [here](http://maximumoctopus.com/electronics/shiftotron.htm)
- Get the software running on a raspberry pi (3B+? or will a zero work?)
- Breadboard a prototype LED matrix and control it
- Wire together a 3D grid of LEDs
- Make a nice case
- Add a screen? Links to satellites on web trackers for more info?
- Write up what you've made!
